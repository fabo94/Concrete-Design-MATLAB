% Function to calculate nominal moment of a reinforced concrete beam.
% Some restrictions apply:
% 1. It considers that the beam is "well-designed", whcih means that
% the steel strain is greater than the steel yielding strain. If this
% condition is not met, the program will return an error.
% 2. It only considers the steel of the tension side of the beam and
% ignores the contribution of steel to compression. Therefore, when introducing
% As, introduce the tension steel area only.
% 3. In case that you have several vertical layers of steel, please 
% calculate d as the height of the beam minus the distance from the 
% bottom to the mass-centroid of the tension beams.
% 4. In case you don't know how to calculate beta1, you can use the function
% "calculate_beta1" available in this repository:https://github.com/fabo94/Concrete-Design-MATLAB
% 5. Please be sure that you are using consistent units
function [Mn,T,C,epsilon_s,c,a] = get_Mn(As,fy,fc,b,d,beta1,epsilon_y)
% As: area of tension steel
% fy: minimum yielding stress of the steel
% fc: f'c compression resistance of the concrete at 28 days
% b: width of the beam
% d: height of the beam minus the distance from the bottom of the beam to the mass-centroid 
%    of the tension steel
% beta1: parameter based on f'c 
% epsilon_y: yielding strain of steel. Can be calculated as fy/ModulusOfYoungOfSteel(Es)
% 
% Calculate the neutral axis position assuming that the steel is yielding
a = As*fy/(0.85*fc*b); 
c = a/beta1; 
% Calculate epsilon_s for the assumed case
epsilon_s = (d-c)*0.003/c;
% If assumption was true, calculate Mn
if epsilon_s<epsilon_y
    error("Bad design! This type of beam is not yielding at ultimate conditions. Therefore, it is out of the scope of this program.")
else
    Mn = As*fy*(d-a/2) * (12/1)^2;
end
% Calculate tension and compression
T = As*fy* (12/1)^2;
C = 0.85*fc*a*b* (12/1)^2;
end
